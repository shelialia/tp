## ***Overview***
---
* This is **GUESTNOTE**.<br>
GuestNote is a **desktop application for managing hotel guests**, optimized for fast typists. It allows hotel concierges to efficiently handle guest information, track requests, manage check-ins and check-outs using a **command-line interface (CLI)**.

### **Value Proposition**
---

> 1. Log requests and preferences in real-time.
> 2. Retrieve relevant guest list and past data. 
> To provide guests with a tailored experience, a home away from home.
