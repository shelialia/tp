# GuestNote User Guide
**Welcome to GuestNote!**  
> Time is money, and in the hotel industry, every second counts.

Mistakes in guest handling - like assigning the wrong room or forgetting a special request - don’t just hurt your workflow. They hurt your guests’ experience and cost your hotel real money.  

**That’s where GuestNote comes in.**

Adapted from [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](#glossary), **GuestNote** takes the core of a reliable contact management system and reimagines it for hotel operations. The result? A lightning-fast desktop app built for concierges and front desk staff, designed for the speed of a [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary), but with the clarity of a [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#glossary), when managing hotel guests. Think of it as muscle memory meets modern [User Interface (UI)](#glossary) – if you can type, you can fly.

### Locating guests: `find`

<box theme="primary" icon=":mif-question-mark:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

The `find` command now searches across all guest fields by default—including name, email, phone number, room number, and requests. Use this command to search for a keyword that may appear in any field.
* At least one keyword must be provided.
* The search is case-insensitive (e.g. `john` matches `John`).
* Only full words are matched. For example, `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* The search is performed across all guest fields (name, phone number, room number, and requests).
* Guests matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. an OR search).

</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":mif-warning:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

**Warning:**
- Avoid using overly generic or very short keywords, as these may produce unintended matches.
- Because the command uses an OR search across all fields, multiple keywords can broaden your search results more than expected.

</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":mif-done:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

Sample Input: `find BOOKED` <br>
Shows all guests with the status `BOOKED`. You can also apply this for other statuses like `CHECKED IN` or `CHECKED OUT`, however you will need to use `find CHECKED_IN` and `find CHECKED_OUT` instead. 
</box>
<box theme="success" icon=":mif-done:"  style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0em" seamless>

Sample Input: `find 03-04` <br>
Shows all guests where any field (e.g. email, name) contains the full word "03-04" (e.g. "03-04"). This is useful for looking up the guests in a specific room. Note that the `#` symbol is not required.

### Notes on the data file
---
<div style="background-color:#fafafa; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<box theme="success" icon=":mif-done:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>
Any changes to the data are immediately saved to the data file. **There is no need to save manually.**
</box>
<box theme="primary" icon=":mif-question-mark:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

The data file is stored in the home folder of GuestNote, where you placed the GuestNote jar file.
- The data file is named `guestnote.json` and is created automatically when you run the application for the first time.
- The data file is used to store all the guest information in JSON format, which is a standard format for storing data in a structured way.

</box>
<box theme="warning" icon=":mif-warning:" style="margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:0px" seamless>

**Caution:** Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file, however, please note:
- If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, GuestNote will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, **it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it**.<br>
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause the GuestNote to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, **edit the data file only if you are confident** that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous GuestNote home folder.

**Q**: What should I do if the app crashes or behaves unexpectedly?<br>
**A**: Ensure you are using the correct version of Java as specified in the Quick Start section. If the issue persists, check the log files for any error messages and report them to the support team.

**Q**: Can I use GuestNote on multiple computers simultaneously?<br>
**A**: GuestNote is designed to be used on a single computer. Using it on multiple computers simultaneously may lead to data inconsistencies.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimised Help Window.
3. **Slow performance on large guest lists**, if the guest list contains a large number of entries, the application may experience slow performance. The remedy is to periodically clear out old or unnecessary entries.
